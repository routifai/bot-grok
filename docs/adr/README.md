# Architecture decision records

One file per decision, numbered in order. A superseded record keeps its file with a status line at the top. Add a record when a change alters a boundary, a vocabulary, a data model or a user-facing rule; log pure removals in `../engine-trim.md` and cite the record that allowed them.

| [0030](0030-a-file-opens-in-one-studio.md) | A file opens in one studio | Accepted 2026-10-19; supersedes 0024's panel-then-studio flow, version reloads and the empty studio chat |
