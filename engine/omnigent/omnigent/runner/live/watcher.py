"""Polls the modified time of the files live pages read, and reports a change to the engine.

A thread of the runner in a managed Computer. Every ``INTERVAL_SECONDS`` it asks the engine which
files to watch (``GET /v1/live/watch``: only the sources of live pages, never the whole disk),
looks at their modified time and size, and posts the ones that changed (``POST /v1/live/changed``).
With the same call it says how busy the Computer is (free memory share, load per CPU), which sizes
how many update runs the engine starts at once. The engine debounces and starts the update. The
first look at a file only records it, so a restart starts nothing; nothing is seen while the
Computer sleeps (the schedule is the safety net). Files
change here without going through the engine (the AI or a shell writes them), which is why this
polls the disk instead of listening to uploads. Rules: ``docs/live-artifacts.md``.
