"""Which model reorders a Computer's search hits, resolved through the model layer.

``files_query`` reads its best hits again with a small chat model. Like embeddings, the call is
made by the Computer through the model proxy; this only answers *which* provider and model, with
the same resolution as a run (the person's own connection, then the organization's, among the
providers whose upstream speaks Chat Completions) and the same suspension and budget checks. It
never falls back to an operator key. A cheap model is used on purpose: the rerank reads twenty
short passages: the owner's Light model, the same one background work runs on. With no usable
catalog the rerank is skipped (``no_model``), never guessed.
