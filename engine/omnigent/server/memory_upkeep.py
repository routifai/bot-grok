"""Server-side scheduling for the memory upkeep job (Phase 3).

Two triggers (``docs/context.md``): applies only to ``superside-chat`` sessions
(native-CLI ``rollover`` sessions keep today's behaviour unchanged).

- :class:`MemoryUpkeepCoordinator` — fire-and-forget, at most one in-flight
  run per user, scheduled right after a ``superside-chat`` session's
  compaction item is recorded (``routes/sessions/routes_events.py``, via
  :mod:`omnigent.superchat.memory`).
- :class:`MemoryUpkeepScheduler` — an hourly sweep (mirrors
  :class:`~omnigent.server.managed_sandbox_reaper.ManagedSandboxReaper`)
  that enqueues a run for every recently-active user.

Both ultimately call :func:`omnigent.memory.upkeep.run_upkeep_once`, which
holds the real per-user lease (a ``running`` row) — the in-process dedup
sets here are just a cheap short-circuit for the common case.

Beside them, :class:`SessionFolds` runs the fold (ADR 0031): after a superside-chat turn
completes, it checks in the background whether the session's past is due to be folded into its
checkpoint and folds it on the owner's Light model
(:func:`omnigent.superchat.rollover.fold_session`). A stored fold then schedules upkeep, as a
compaction always did.
