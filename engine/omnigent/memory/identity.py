"""The person's own organisation, as far as memory and their address say (ADR 0035, amended).

Topic watch treats the person's own organisation as a common term (every work email names it),
and the quiet pass is told it so topics are never watched by it. Both read it here.

Derivation is deliberately conservative, code only:

- **Organisation names** come from the person's own ``fact`` claims (written "The user ...") that
  say where they work: "works at / for / with X", "employed at / by X", "employee of X",
  "employer / company / organisation / firm is X", "is a <role> at X". ``X`` is the run of
  capitalised words (at most four) right after the phrase; anything else is ignored.
- **Domains** come from the person's own addresses: their owner id when it is an address (header
  and OIDC modes) and an address a fact claim gives as "the user's (work) email". Consumer mail
  providers are skipped. The domain's name label counts as an organisation word too (``rbc``
  from ``rbc.com``).
