"""What reads a Round's record once a batch of its events is stored (ADR 0029).

* :class:`Announcer` folds a Round whose record grew and sends its summary as ``round.updated``
  on the Conversation's family stream, at most once per :data:`ANNOUNCE_EVERY` seconds per Round
  and only while a family stream is open.
* :func:`item_rounds` cuts a run of a Conversation's items into the Rounds they are in, which
  :func:`attach_round_ids` puts on each transcript message (``round_id``) and the Activity rows
  read; :func:`open_rounds` lists the Rounds whose Helpers still work (the turn prefix and the
  context brief).
* :func:`attach_round_files` draws a transcript page's file cards from each recorded Round's
  view instead of from the save calls on the page.
* :func:`shadow_diff`, on when :data:`SHADOW_ENV` is set, folds a Round after a turn of it ends
  and logs at INFO each way the fold disagrees with what the engine derives today from the
  stored items and Helper sessions: status, start time, files and Helpers. Development only;
  nothing it finds reaches a person.
