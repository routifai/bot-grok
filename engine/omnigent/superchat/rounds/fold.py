"""The Round view is a fold over the Round's events (ADR 0029, principle 3). Pure: no store, no
clock, no I/O, and the view it returns shares nothing with the events it was given.

An event is a flat mapping: ``t`` (seconds), ``kind``, ``actor``, ``round_id`` and the kind's
fields (:mod:`omnigent.superchat.rounds.record` writes them). Settlement, Stop, a failed
Helper and events that arrive after settlement are cases of the fold, not rules beside it:

* A Round is **settled** when no Assistant turn runs, no Helper runs and no Helper result waits
  for the Assistant turn that reads it. Settlement is checked after every event and never moves
  once set.
* **Stop** settles the Round at once: every running Helper reads stopped, and the Stop line
  (:func:`stop_line`) names what was still working and what was saved.
* After settlement an event is kept in ``after_settle`` and changes nothing, except a
  ``turn.ended`` (it commits the words streamed before it) and a ``helper.finished`` (it keeps
  the late result on its Helper).
* An Assistant ``turn.ended`` with no Assistant turn running is the engine settling a Round no
  turn is coming for (a reset, or a Round left without one): no turn reads the Helper results
  it still holds.
* A Round that settles on an Assistant ``turn.ended`` whose status is ``failed`` (a model error,
  a turn the relay lost with no reply stored, a reset, a Round the sweep found with no turn to
  come) is **failed**, with that end's ``reason``; one that settles on any other end is done.
* A ``wake`` that came while a turn of the Conversation ran (``steered``; that turn may be
  another Round's) is read by that turn, or by the turn the runner runs right after it for the
  queued notice. ``session.idle`` (the Conversation's session went idle with nothing queued)
  says it was: the steered results count as read then, and the Round may settle.
* ``helper.titled`` renames a Helper (its model-written name), before or after settlement.
* Each actor has one live slot (the Assistant, or one Helper by its id): the newest tool it
  started. ``now`` is the slot started last; a settled Round has none.
