"""Write a Round's events where the engine sees each fact (ADR 0029), and journal it once settled.

* :func:`assign_round` is the one rule for which Round a stored message belongs to.
* :class:`Recorder` appends events in order on a background task: a write never blocks the
  turn or the request that saw the fact, and a failed write is logged, never raised. Streamed
  words are joined per :data:`WORDS_EVERY` seconds. Each stored batch is handed to the
  recorder's ``on_written`` (:mod:`omnigent.superchat.rounds.read`).
* :class:`RelayRound` turns one session's runner stream, as the server relays it, into events:
  turns, words, tool calls, a Helper's finish, chips and checklist changes.
* :func:`note_message`, :func:`helper_created` and :func:`file_saved` are the writers at a
  stored message, a Helper's creation and an artifact save.
* :func:`stop_round` is Stop: it picks the Round the person stops, records ``stop.requested``
  and returns the Stop line; :func:`stopped_wake` tells a Helper's late notice of a stopped
  Round from one that may still start a turn.
* Settlement is detected where the settling events are written: after the :class:`Recorder`
  stored a ``turn.ended``, ``helper.finished`` or ``stop.requested``, it folds that Round and,
  the first time the fold says settled, hands :func:`journal_entry` of the view to its
  ``on_settled`` sink (the Round's one journal entry, written in the host).
* :func:`close_lost_turns` ends, from the stored conversation, a turn whose stream the relay
  lost (its runner tunnel dropped mid-turn): the relay calls it when its session reports idle
  or its relay ends for good, and :class:`Sweep` every :data:`SWEEP_EVERY` seconds for a turn
  open longer than :data:`LOST_AFTER` whose session is idle. A Round cannot stay running past
  its sessions going idle.

Only Superchat sessions are recorded; a session outside a Round records nothing.
