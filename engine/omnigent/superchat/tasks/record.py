"""What a turn reads in front of the person's message, and the one rule for when a turn ends
well.

Pure: no store, no HTTP. The runner writes :func:`prefix_lines` in front of the person's
message: the pick on a card, then one :func:`round_line` per Round still working (ADR 0029,
read from the Round record). The scenario evals judge each turn with :func:`ends_well`. The
task records of ADR 0025 are gone; the ``tasks`` table keeps only old rows, dropped with their
Conversation.
