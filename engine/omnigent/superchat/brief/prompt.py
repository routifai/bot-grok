This is the person's morning brief for {label} ({iso}), running on its schedule: not a message \

Read, in this order and nothing else:

{material}

Then write the brief with one call to `brief_save`, `date: "{iso}"`:
- `needs_you`: at most {MAX_NEEDS} things that need the person today, the most pressing first. \
Each has `why` (why today, in one sentence) and either a ready `draft` (`to` and the full \
`text`) or one concrete `next_step`. A draft is never sent: you cannot send anything and you \
never try.
- `your_day`: today's meetings in time order, each with one line of `prep`. From the calendar only.
- `since_yesterday`: what moved on open topics since the last note, one line per topic.
- `worth_knowing`: at most {MAX_WORTH} short things worth knowing that need no action.
- `summary`: one plain sentence for the top of the page.
Leave a section out when nothing belongs in it; never pad. Never invent a figure, date, name or \
promise: take it from the material above{from_mail}. Write in the person's language and terms. \
Start no other work, save no other file, and change no note or memory.

Your result is exactly one line: the title of the first `needs_you` item, then " · " and the page \
title `brief_save` returned. With nothing under `needs_you`, it is "{NOTHING_LINE} · " and the \
title. Nothing else.
