"""The fold and the checkpoint of superside-chat sessions (ADR 0031).

A session's past is folded into its checkpoint (the tagged working list and the journal lines)
by :func:`roll_over_session`, the one summarizer. The fold runs in the engine after a turn
(:func:`fold_session`, scheduled by ``server/memory_upkeep.py``) when the settled-turn lines a
new session would list pass 2k tokens or the warm context reaches :func:`fold_at`, on the
owner's Light model. It only writes the checkpoint: it never drops a warm client, and a turn
never waits on it. The manual ``/compact`` (``runner/app.py``) runs the same function and then
drops the warm client. A new session is assembled from the checkpoint and the record after its
anchor (``_load_history_as_input``); a restart or a return from idle never summarizes. Whether a
warm client is handed off before a turn (size, return, cache expiry, a Claude model switch) is
decided in one place, :func:`handoff_reason`.

    The fold (``server/memory_upkeep.py``) leaves *on_rolled_over* unset: it only writes the

    already building for the same session returns ``False`` at once. Every failure (history
    load, summarization, a cut-off reply, the store, a hook) is logged and swallowed, and the
    previous checkpoint stays.

    *cause* names the reason in the checkpoint's header. *on_stored* gets the stored item and
    the window it folded once it is persisted, before *on_rolled_over*. *on_failed* gets the
