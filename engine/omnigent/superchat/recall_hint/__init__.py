"""Recall for the context brief: the per-message planner and the ``recall_hint`` setting.

Layout: ``planner`` (the cheap model call and its code fallback), ``hint`` (the shared per-message
plan, the search, the pointer line; runner side, read by the context brief), ``preference`` (the
``recall_hint`` setting and ``/v1/me/recall-hint``: on by default, ADR 0027), this module
(registration). Nothing goes in the turn prefix and it adds no tool: the brief carries what it
finds, and the pull path is the ``recall`` tool.
