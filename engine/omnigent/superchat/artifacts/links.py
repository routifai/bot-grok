"""Which artifact a person's message is about, and which message a version came from.

docs/conversation.md (ADR 0021). A message gets its link three ways: the artifact open beside
the chat when it was sent (``open``, from the message event's ``context``), the first save
during its turn (``edited``), or the person's pick on the chip (``chosen``). A version records
the person's message in the Conversation that led to it (``item_id``). The links live in the
artifact store (``message_artifacts``); the transcript reads them onto the person's messages,
and a change is announced on the family stream so the web redraws the chip.
