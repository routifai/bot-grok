"""When a turn ends well (ADR 0025), speaks first (ADR 0026) and keeps the machinery out of
its words (ADR 0029).

Pure functions for the offline harness and the live runner. Whether a turn ends well is the
engine's own rule (:func:`omnigent.superchat.tasks.record.ends_well`); this module only reads a
scripted turn as the engine's :class:`~omnigent.superchat.tasks.record.Turn`.

A turn is a list of events, ``(kind, detail)`` pairs. The first event opens the turn:

- ``request``: the person asks for a deliverable (a deck, page, document, sheet or file); no task
  is open yet, the turn's own work opens one;
- ``answer``: the person answers a question card, which continues an open task;
- ``message``: anything else the person says (a question, a lookup, chat);
- ``steer``: a message about work a Helper of the open task is running;
- ``notice``: a Helper's progress, flag or result waking the conversation.

What follows is what the assistant did: ``tool_call`` (detail: the tool name), ``card`` (a
question card; detail: what it asks about), ``helper_started``, ``message_helper``,
``save``, ``reply`` (detail: the text), and what the engine adds: ``refused`` (the step limit
refused a call; detail: the tool name), ``cancelled`` (the person stopped the turn), and the
work a Helper reported while it ran: ``helper_save`` (it saved a draft) and ``check`` (it ran a
check; detail: the tool).
